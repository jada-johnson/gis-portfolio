# GIS-Portfolio
This is my portfolio for the Advanced GIS course!

## About Me
I'm originally from Houston, TX, and I landed here at CMU by way of ungraduate in Los Angeles, CA. I'm a second year MSPPM student with a concentration in environmental policy. I really hope to work on securing access to safe, clean drinking water, especially as climate change affects the sort of access that we will have to such a vital resource. 💦

Mapping some of the data surrounding this issue can really help visually contextualize the gravity of the situation, and through the skills learned in this course, I hope to contribute to the awareness- and action-oriented efforts being made globally. This is my second GIS course, and given how much I truly enjoyed the first, I cannot wait to dive into the material!

## What I Hope to Learn

Speaking of skills learned in this course, I hope to gain better knowledge on how to manage GIS projects from start to finish with better documentation strategy and additional methods that will allow me to produce more detailed maps that can be shared to a multitude of platforms. Additionally, I'm excited to explore remote sensing and spatial data science given my climate change mitigation interests. Of course, there are topics I'm sure I'm failing to mention right off of the bat, but I'm also sure I'll enjoy getting an introduction to them all the same!
