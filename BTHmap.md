# Response to Breakthrough Houston RFP

Breakthrough Houston (BTH) is an educational program with the aim of placing motivated students from underserved backgrounds on a path to college, and they have sites throughout the Greater Houston Metropolitan area that allow them to facilitate programming in different areas in town. While some people are familiar with the program, they may not necessarily know which site is closest to them. BTH has put out an RFP to get their mapping needs met. Below are the steps I took to bid for and fulfill their needs.
