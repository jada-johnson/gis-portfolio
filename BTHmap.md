# Response to Breakthrough Houston RFP

Breakthrough Houston (BTH) is an educational program with the aim of placing motivated students from underserved backgrounds on a path to college, and they have sites throughout the Greater Houston Metropolitan area that allow them to facilitate programming in different areas in town.
